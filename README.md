λ-expressions provide a useful notation in which new function symbols are constructed “on the fly.” For
example, the function that squares its argument can be written as (λx x × x) and can be applied to arguments
just like any other function symbol. A λ-expression can also be defined and used as a predicate symbol. (See
Chapter 22.) The lambda operator in Lisp plays exactly the same role. Notice that the use of λ in this way does
not increase the formal expressive power of first-order logic, because any sentence that includes a λ-expression
can be rewritten by “plugging in” its arguments to yield an equivalent sentence.


The function Arity(c, i, j) says that circuit c has i input and j out-
put terminals. The connectivity between gates can be represented by a predicate, Connected ,
which takes two terminals as arguments, as in Connected (Out(1, X 1 ), In(1, X 2 )).
